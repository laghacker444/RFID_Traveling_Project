# RFID_Traveling_Project
A smart RFID-based fare management system using GPS, cloud (AWS DynamoDB), and real-time QR code payments. It calculates fare via Haversine formula, logs travel data locally and to the cloud, and enables UPI payments. Arduino-based validation ensures secure, cashless transit with live fare display.
